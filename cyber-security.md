## Red Teaming
Predominantly composed of two things: alternative analysis and adversary simulation. Red teams do not attempt to find “all the vulnerabilities'' and do not usually try to have a wide breadth of coverage. Instead, red teams seek to simulate an adversary with a particular objective, predominantly to act as a “sparring partner” for blue teams. Keep in mind, red teams are the only adversary that will debrief with the blue team so that the blue team can figure out what they missed or could have done differently.

## Certifications
- Blurb from Bobby Cooke @ IBM Red Team: From my XP, for Red Team engagements you are going to be going up against clients that are mature enough to do Red Team engagements. This means that they will probably have Active Directory, and you will be going up against millions of dollars of security systems and a CSOC/blue-team. IMO you're going to have to code your own tools or heavily modify existing. So pretty much we need the operator - skills from CRTO/CRTP tool dev skills from OSEP/Sektor7, and maldev skills from Sektor7.
    1. OSCP (for netpen basics)
    2. CRTO (Learn Red Teaming zero>Hero) - https://training.zeropointsecurity.co.uk/courses/red-team-ops
    3. CRTP (Red Teaming LOL style & PowerShell)
    4. OSEP (Red Team tooldev & nailing down C#)
    5. @SEKTOR7net (Red Team C tooldev & malware Dev)
- Blue Team - CyberDefender
- GIAC - Exploit Dev
- GIAC - GREM
- SANS - FOR508 / FOR610
- CRTO - ZeroPoint
- SANS - Cyber Threat Intel, Threat Hunting, Incidence Response, Digital Forensics, Red Team Ops Adversary Emulation, Enterprise Pen Testing
- Blurb: Why I like OSCP as a baseline certificate for roles in my team: to have it, you need a variety of skills that are useful in my line of work. You need:
    - a bit of networking
    - a bit of binary analysis
    - a bit of intrusion methodology a bit of intrusion techniques
    - a bit of information gathering
    - a bit of exploitation, a bit of OS, a bit of tenacity, a bit of scripting
